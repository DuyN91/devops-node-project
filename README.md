To fill with list of tests.

# NodeJS Project
We couldn't manage to write user information into the database for a new account. So we were unable to continue the project, we did implement some of the user's password related function please see to it. We counldn't manage to use the UserHandler "get" and "save" function allowing us to use the database.
